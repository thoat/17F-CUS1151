## Homework: Project 1
We started on Thursday, 2017.09.07.

Thu, 2017.09.07:
* We filled in the `Node` class. Each node has a data field and a link to the next node (one-way link).

* Then we filled out `ListQueue` class: constructors and 3 methods (`enqueue()`, `dequeue()`, `front()`). For each, we figured out the cases there would be, such as an empty queue, one-element queue, and many-element queue.

Sun, 2017.09.10:
* We got `testEmpty()` and `testOne()` to work. 
For each test, we test the `front()`, then `dequeue()`, then `enqueue()`, in the order of how those methods impact the queue's original state; otherwise, we will not be testing what we are supposed to. For example, when we want to test the methods on an empty queue, if we enqueue() before front(), the queue is no longer empety.
